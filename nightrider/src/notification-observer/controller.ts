/**
 * CONTROLLER for notification-observer Observer
 *
 * PRD REQUIREMENTS:
 * CONTROLLER (orchestration):
 * - Handles email notifications
 * - Observer for email notifications processing notification-queue events
 * - Error handling and retry logic for email delivery
 *
 * MUST IMPLEMENT:
 * 1. Queue event processing and message parsing
 * 2. SMTP client management and email sending
 * 3. Delivery retry logic with exponential backoff
 * 4. Template rendering and personalization
 * 5. Delivery status tracking and error reporting
 *
 * INTERFACES TO EXPORT:
 * - processNotificationEvent(event: NotificationEvent): Promise<DeliveryResult>
 * - sendEmail(recipient: string, subject: string, body: string): Promise<EmailResult>
 * - renderEmailTemplate(template: string, data: any): string
 * - retryFailedDelivery(event: NotificationEvent, attempt: number): Promise<DeliveryResult>
 * - trackDeliveryStatus(messageId: string): Promise<DeliveryStatus>
 *
 * IMPORTS NEEDED:
 * - From shared types: NotificationEvent, SMTPConfig, ValidationError
 * - From env: env.SMTP_HOST, env.SMTP_PORT, env.SMTP_USER, env.SMTP_PASSWORD, env.logger
 * - From other layers: model functions for validation and formatting
 *
 * BUSINESS RULES:
 * - Process all events from notification-queue
 * - Retry failed deliveries up to 3 times with exponential backoff
 * - High priority messages sent immediately
 * - Normal priority messages can be batched
 * - All delivery attempts logged with status
 *
 * ERROR HANDLING:
 * - Try-catch around all SMTP operations
 * - Queue failed messages for retry
 * - Log delivery failures with full context
 * - Alert on persistent delivery failures
 *
 * INTEGRATION POINTS:
 * - Triggered by notification-queue events
 * - Uses SMTP configuration from environment secrets
 * - Logs delivery status for monitoring
